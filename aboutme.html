	<p> Growing up I always had an appreciation for poetry and writing but I never considered myself to be a writer and I especially did not consider myself to be an artist. I didn't start to explore writing and art until the end of my junior year of high school. I was at a point in my life where I felt I was not doing much to push myself. I was coasting through life and I felt unfulfilled. I made the decision to get involved in a poetry program over the summer and challenged myself to put my best foot forward. As I learned more about poetry and art culture I realized that I had a deep passion for free expression. Through poetry I was able to express myself fully in a way that I never did before. It made me more open, receptive, and enthusiastic. I have made great friends and met many talented people through art. It is something that I can't put a price on. My goal as an artist is to give people the platform they deserve to be able to tell their stories in a judge-free space.
