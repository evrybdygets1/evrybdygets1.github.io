	Water by the Spoonful <br />

	Background noises <br />
	Jazzy Tunes <br />
	Chattering Actors <br />
	Playwright Blues <br />
	Stories Climax <br />
	Intermission in the middle of indecision <br />
	Reflection of chaotic minds <br />
	Isolated moods frying over crispy psychosis <br />
	Dissecting the difference between noise <br />
	And social dissonance <br />
	Consistent dripping of leaky faucets <br />
	Parched conscience <br />
	Counting down to the relapse of addictive tendencies <br />
	Every five minutes <br />
	Drink water by the spoonful <br />
	For a few seconds of living <br />

		Lizeth <br />

		She spun through fire <br />
		She wanted to dance the pain away <br />
		Bathing in flames day after day after day <br />
		My favorite part of every movie is the moment <br />
		Where understanding is disfigured <br />
		In this particular scene <br />
		She tells me in her sign to fade out <br />
		detached erosion provocative provocative of a recluse <br />
		that threatens her extrovert with lithium laced fingernails <br />
		scratching the surface of who she wants to be <br />
		she stares into nothing <br />
		they ask me how I can see life in her departed eyes <br />
		well... the dead have more reason to appreciate life and we don't feel enough <br />
		she stares into nothing to make the seconds stretch just a little longer <br />
		To find the spot where she feels she belongs <br />
		To fill the void inadvertently created cause she rejects the soul <br />
		Tried to cover up her scars with broken bottles of corona, piercings, tattoos, and an attitude she thinks is hardcore <br />
		She sings in her solitude <br />
		Dreams when nobody is looking <br />
		And smiles in the silence between every word <br />
		she spun through fire <br />
		danced the pain away <br />
		bathed in flames <br />
		to numb the pain of pretending to be somebody who isn't alive <br />
		she is alive in everything she does <br />
		The way she lives is as beautiful as it is painful <br />
		I just couldn't find the right words to tell her <br />

		You can see the sillage in the smoke <br />
See they eyes full of hope <br />
The cadence in the words is prevalent <br />
What I’m spitting you is dope <br />
Slang like Malcolm Marukambe <br />
Picture this <br />
Alternative black kid <br />
From the hood <br />
With a knack for splitting lips <br />
Cause the truth is hard to swallow from the mouth of a liar <br />
So let a young educated nigga from city slums <br />
Be ya dope supplier <br />
Serving fire like I was born to breathe it soul glo like my shine undefeated <br />
Repeated lines from Saul Williams with dreams of people <br />
Feeling the way I lay my veins over paper to bleed a little truth <br />
And open up my mind <br />
To lay lines over the hearts of the disenfranchised youth <br />
Spitting potent potion to help you find the missing component <br />
You got to own it <br />
Wear ya heart on ya sleeve <br />
That’s the only release <br />
In a world full of liars and thieves <br />
Allow me to supply you with some relief <br />
Peaceful pieces spoken smoothly as the crease in a cuffed pair of selvedge jeans <br />
It’s mean and vicious  <br />
the way I push writtens over skipped beats and broken melodies <br />
For every crack in the street <br />
And every crook in my teeth <br />
I swear I’ll never stop providing the purest form of therapy <br />
